# Advanced Regression Assignment - House Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
# Business Objective
> You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. Ridge and Lasso Regeression

## General Information
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- From the three models Linear. Ridge and Lasso, Lasso Regression model is the best among the three as the accuracy is high and error is less compared to other models. Also, Lasso brings coefficient to zero for insignificant features, It is preferable to use Lasso Regression.
- Top 5 most important predictor variables are GrLivArea, OverallQual, LotArea, BsmtFinSF1 and TotalBsmtSF.
